       <h2>Shantae Saddler</h2>
       <p>I went to Immaculate Conception High School, the best high school in Jamaica. I am currently in my final year at the University of the West Indies. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and philosophy. The reason why I chose to do Web Development is becuase I thought it would be fun and exciting to know how to develop my own websites. Plus it would come in hand if one day I choose to start my own online business. </p>
